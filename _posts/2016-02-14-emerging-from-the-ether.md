I am a dark matter developer.

The first time I heard tell of a "dark matter developer," was from Scott Hanselman \{[twitter] [1] \| [website] [2]\} and he defines them as ...

> [...] another kind of developer than the ones we meet all the time. We call them Dark Matter Developers. They don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large conferences. Where are these dark matter developers online?

The article goes on to talk about this invisible force being rather productive.  They're not using the latest technologies, worrying about which IoC container to use, or having arguments about which source code control system is better.  Yet, they're solving business problems and getting things done.

I'm a consultant and I do spend time reading blogs, going to user groups, debating technological approaches, and attending conferences.  I do worry about which IoC container to use and often tell people which source control software I think is best.  My passion for the craft is where I stand out from the other dark matter developers.  Their passions lie elsewhere and there's nothing wrong with that.

So, if I claim to be so different, why do I open this post claiming to be the same?  Quite simply, because I'm as **invisible** as they are.

I spend a lot of time writing software most people will never see.  The majority of it hides behind corporate firewalls and is protected by NDAs.  Like my software, I remain hidden.  The software development landscape has changed a great deal in the last few years.  If you're not committing to GitHub, blogging about the newest JavaScript framework, or speaking on [microservices] [4] at a conference you're invisible.  

No more.  Invisible I shall be no longer.

Today begins a new chapter.  I have thoughts, ideas, and of course code to share and contribute to the collective software development consciousness.  It's time I start doing that.  My wish for you, the reader, is that you may find something useful among these pages.  If so, then I've done my job.

I <s>am</s> **was** a dark matter developer.  Welcome to my blog.
