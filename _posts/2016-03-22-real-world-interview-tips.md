As a software consultant, interviewing is one of the most important skills you can have.  You can be the most technically competent person in the entire organization, but you won’t be able to prove it if you don't make it through the interview.  I recently interviewed for an assignment that I did not get.  I feel I made some mistakes during the interview and wanted to share what I learned.  Perhaps you can find something useful and avoid making similar mistakes during your next interview.

### Be yourself

Trite?  Maybe.  While people are often told to 'be themselves' when interviewing, there is a good reason why this advice bears repeating.

The truth is, the majority of us exude different personas depending on the audience.  We act differently when around strangers than when we are with friends.  We don’t show our co-workers the same side we show our families.  Then there’s who we are when no one else is around.  There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, it’s simply a manifestation of the fact that we are complex people with multiple dimensions to our personalities.

When interviewing, we're trying to impress someone enough with our skills and personality that they want to offer us a job.  We project a completely different persona in this situation.

> I’ve unscientifically dubbed it the “I'm trying to impress someone” persona.

This is where we start getting into trouble.  There are a series of subtle personality differences that emerge here.  We may not notice them, but they are blindingly obvious to others.  One of those differences is "playing to our strengths."  While this is another useful piece of advice in most situations, in this state we usually go too far. 

For example, I tend to be a relaxed, easy going and jovial person.  I consider these my strengths. However in "impress mode", I believe I start to play these attributes up to an extreme.  Perhaps, I'm trying to be too funny.  With this, people might mistake this as being unable to be serious about anything.  There's also the possibility of clashing senses of humor.  You don’t want to bomb the interview because every joke you told fell flat.  

Some may see my relaxed attitude as apathy.  They get a sense that I don’t have the ability to be dedicated to their product.  I've overplayed my strengths to such an extreme they are hurting my chances at getting this assignment.  The worst part is, we don't even know it is happening until it's too late.  This doesn’t mean you can’t be funny or relaxed.  The interviewer wants to actually enjoy working alongside you, after all.

OK, so how do we stop doing this?

> Before you can "be yourself," you have to "know thyself."

Learn what happens when you're trying to impress someone and tame those actions.  Your friends have probably seen this side of you at least once; ask them.  Have them point out areas that you should focus on developing.  Attending a group like [ToastMasters][1] could be beneficial as well.  While not directly related to interviewing, it is public speaking training and a lot of the same issues apply.  You can have the group help find your tics in a safe environment.  Then, when you get the job and a raise, buy that friend dinner (and/or whisky) as a thank you.

### Be prepared...know your résumé

Is this post going to be full of nothing but trite sayings?  No, but repetition is the key to remembering very important ideas.

There's a lot of talk these days about how résumés are outdated and your GitHub profile and StackOverflow rating are all you need.  While that's a conversation for another day, in non-startup corporate America, the résumé remains king.

> Your résumé will be the document that lands you the in-person interview.  It’s very, very important.  Equally as important, is knowing what you actually put in it!

I realize some of the items are from three jobs ago, but if you listed it, you should be able to talk about it.  If you can't answer a couple questions on most of the bullet points, they should be removed.

Strike two during my interview.  When asked about this feature I wrote, and was quite proud of doing, I couldn't remember the details.  I fumbled around and I’m sure it looked bad.  You don't need to remember everything about everything, just something about most of them.  There’s also some opportunity to take control of the interview here.  Make sure you speak of the things in your résumé you do know really well.  Point out during the interview, “When I worked at Company X, you’ll see I did Thing Y.”  This helps make sure you get your strong points covered if the interviewer glosses over them.

### Respect your recommendations

It's very commonplace to have friends and former co-workers, who currently work there, put in a good word for you.  When this happens, there’s something very important taking place.  That person is taking the credibility they've earned and are spending some of it to give you a head start above other candidates.  Credibility is a valuable asset that takes a considerable amount of time to earn, and you shouldn't take it lightly.

I feel I messed up here too.  A friend of mine spent some of her credibility and talked me up to the interviewer.  I was asked "Why does she think so highly of you?" during the interview.  I thought it an odd question and I’m not sure I’ve ever been asked that.  It caught me off guard.  I believe I was way too flippant and comedic with my answer (see above).  More importantly, I didn't give my friend the respect she deserved for her recommendation of me.  I can only hope it doesn’t change how that company looks at her going forward.

> When you get asked "Why does this person think so highly of you?" you better have a damn good answer.

Not so you can look good in front of the interviewer, but as a sign of respect to your friends for withdrawing out of their credibility bank to give your account a positive start.

### Be positive

I'm referring to how to respond to questions more so than I am attitude, although that's important too.  I witnessed this with some co-workers just the other day.  It wasn’t in an interview setting, but the advice most certainly can apply to them as well.

They were asked by a client, "Have you done this specific thing?"  They answered "No, we haven't."  They were being honest; can’t fault them for that.  **Honesty is awesome; be more honest.**  However, don't forget to highlight what you DO know.  Try to avoid saying "No, I don't know that."  If you can say, "I haven't done this specific thing, but I've done another thing which is really close to ...” say that!  It's important for an interviewer to hear more positive than negative things.

### Conclusion

This post was born out of an actual experience of mine.  I was a bit reticent to share for fear of looking bad to the community and other potential clients.  Sure, I could have removed the personal anecdotes; but then it would have been a list I could have lifted from a self-help book.  You don’t want to read that, and I don’t want to write that.  Ultimately, I want others to learn from my mistakes and be successful in getting the job they want.  This also serves as a great pre-interview read the next time I’m making the rounds.
